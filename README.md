# Polymorphism Example in C++

This project demonstrates **runtime polymorphism** using base and derived classes in C++. It shows how `virtual` functions behave differently from regular member functions when accessed through a base class pointer.

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

- Inheritance
- Virtual functions
- Function overriding
- Base class pointers

## 🛠️ Compilation

You can compile the program using `g++`:

```bash
g++ -o polymorphism.cpp 
./polymorphism
